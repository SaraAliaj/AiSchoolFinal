# Database Module Fix for Render Deployment

This document explains how to fix the `pool.promise is not a function` error that occurs when deploying to Render.

## Issue

When deploying to Render, you may encounter this error:

```
TypeError: pool.promise is not a function
    at file:///opt/render/project/src/backend/node/database.js:109:21
```

This happens because we're importing from `mysql2/promise` but also calling `.promise()` on the pool, which is redundant.

## Solution

The fix has been applied to the codebase already and includes:

1. Updating `database.js` to remove the redundant `.promise()` call
2. Adding a fix script that runs during deployment to automatically fix the issue
3. Pinning the mysql2 package to exact version 3.13.0
4. Updating the start.sh script to run the fix before starting the server

## Manual Fix Options

If the automatic fix doesn't work, you can try these methods:

### Option 1: Edit via Render Shell

1. Open your Render dashboard
2. Navigate to your Web Service
3. Go to the "Shell" tab
4. Run the following commands:

```bash
cd /opt/render/project/src/backend/node
cat database.js | grep "pool.promise"
# If it shows the problematic line, fix it:
sed -i 's/export default pool.promise();/export default pool;/' database.js
cat database.js | grep "export default"
# Verify it now shows: export default pool;
```

### Option 2: Run the Fix Script

If the fix script exists but didn't run automatically:

```bash
cd /opt/render/project/src/backend/node
node fix-database-module.js
```

### Option 3: Update Environment Variables

You can also try adding this environment variable to your Render deployment:

```
FIX_DATABASE_MODULE=true
```

## Verifying the Fix

To verify the fix worked, check the logs after deployment to ensure:

1. No `TypeError: pool.promise is not a function` errors
2. Database connections are established successfully
3. The application starts without errors

If the application starts and can connect to the database, the fix was successful.

## Future Deployments

This fix should persist in future deployments as long as the updated code is deployed. The automatic fix script will run on each deployment to ensure the database module remains compatible.
